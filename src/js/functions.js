        <br><br>Gender is an area that most people have opinions about, but fewer have solid knowledge. It is also in many cases about things that affect personal values, \
        which force you to reflect on yourself and your identity. Becoming gender aware is often a slow process of knowledge and learning. Time is needed for \
        dialogue and reflection based on the scientific knowledge that is available. Without an in-depth understanding of how gender is done in everyday practices, \
        it is also close at hand that gender-blind and homosocial practices continue without being problematized."
